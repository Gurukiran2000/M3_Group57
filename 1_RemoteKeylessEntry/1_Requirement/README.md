## REMOTE KEYLESS ENTRY (RKE)
## 1.   INTRODUCTION
## 1.1 ABSTRACT
Remote keyless entry (RKE) is an electronic access system that can be controlled from a distance. RKEs, which are typically used to remotely lock or unlock doors, require the end user to initiate an action that will cause a physical or software key fob to transmit a radio signal to a receiver that controls an electronic lock.Typically, the action is to press a button on a physical fob. Keyless remotes contain a short-range radio transmitter, and must be within a certain range, usually 5â€“20 meters, of the car to work. When a button is pushed, it sends a coded signal by radio waves to a receiver unit in the car, which locks or unlocks the door. Remote keyless entry is commonly used to protect vehicles from theft
